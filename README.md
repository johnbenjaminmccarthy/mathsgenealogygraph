# Maths genealogy graph

This is an app in Typescript using Vite, React, and [d3js](https://d3js.org/) to generate a visualization of the [directed acyclic graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) of a mathematician on the [Mathematical Genealogy Project](https://www.mathgenealogy.org). 

Graph data for individuals is sourced from an API which scrapes from the genealogy project which can be found in the [mathsgenealogyapi repository](https://github.com/johnbenjaminmccarthy/mathsgenealogyapi).

A test version of this project can be found at https://jmccarthy.au/playground/mathgenealogygraph.
